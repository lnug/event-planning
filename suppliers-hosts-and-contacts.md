## Catering
We usually provide free pizza and beer for attendees, as long as it can be paid for by sponsorship. So far this has always been the case. We budget about £500 for a meetup - split roughly evenly between pizza and drinks. 

**BEFORE ORDERING ANYTHING:** Make sure it's clear who's ordering - confirm with others in the group and cc contact@lnug.org. Also confirm that there is money from sponsorship to cover whatever you order


## Pizza
We have been ordering pizza from Olive Hoxton for years and they have been mostly very reliable.

Contact Sam, and ask for confirmation. I usually just send a text message to him like the following - with the details updated each month: 

50 pizzas is usually enough for the 80-120 attendees we have

Budget: £280

### Beer and beverages
I have a shopping list set up on Ocado for this - makes it easy for me. Here's my last order (Jan 2018) - also assuming about 80-120 people. I like to keep it varied - to account for all tastes and for the non-alcoholic drinkers and the craft beer fans alike - so feel free to mix it up. 

Budget: £180-£200
