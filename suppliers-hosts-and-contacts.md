## Venue
We are not bound to any single host or venue - I think we should put effort into moving every 4-6 months  - and rotate the venues. 

Currently we are hosted  at CondÃ© Nast

## Catering
We usually provide free pizza and beer for attendees, as long as it can be paid for by sponsorship. So far this has always been the case. We budget about Â£500 for a meetup - split roughly evenly between pizza and drinks. 

**BEFORE ORDERING ANYTHING:** Make sure it's clear who's ordering - confirm with others in the group and cc contact@lnug.org. Also confirm that there is money from sponsorship to cover whatever you order


## Pizza
We have been ordering pizza from Olive Hoxton for years and they have been mostly very reliable.

```

Contact Sam, and ask for confirmation. I usually just send a text message to him like the following - with the details updated each month: 

50 pizzas is usually enough for the 80-120 attendees we have

Budget: Â£280 - Â£300

Remember to get confirmation - the message has been lost once or twice in the past.
