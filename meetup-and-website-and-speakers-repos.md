# Meetup and website and speakers repos

## lnug/speakers
We coordinate all our information around talks on gihub at [lnug/speakers](https://github.com/lnug/speakers). 

All speakers must create an issue and these _should_ be reviewed, approved and scheduled by more than one LNUG organiser.

The talk proposal is what goes on the website - so sometimes it needs editing before generating the website. 

Some pointers: 

- Be helpful and kind to potential speakers - help them shape their talk into something great that everyone will like. These are the lifeblood of our events. 
- Encourage people you know to make a talk proposal - we always need more speakers
- Consider keeping a talk ready yourself - you never know when a speaker can't make it last minute, and we have 120 attendees wanting to hear someone. 
- Lightning talks are good too  - this can be a great way to get new speakers involved. 
- Promote diversity in speakers
- Spread you planning - don't overload the lineup for a meetup - talks can be scheduled months in advance and it's OK. It also leaves some space and opportunity to add rockstar and/or diversity speakers closer to the meetup, should they turn up unplanned.

There are guidelines to talks - most important is they are 20-25 minutes maximum - and that speakers agree to the Code of Conduct -  I usually add the following in conversation and feedback on the proposal issues: 

```
a couple things we need to confirm: 
- [ ]  Length of talk - needs to be 20-25 mins.
- [ ]  Code of Conduct - as part of our community we need to make sure all speakers agree with that - see https://lnug.org/code-of-conduct.html
```
