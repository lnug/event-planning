a place to help contribute and get involved in planning LNUG events


Here is some helpful info to get you going:

- [Speakers Repos, LNUG.org and Meetup.com](meetup-and-website-and-speakers-repos.md)
- [Suppliers, hosts and contacts](./suppliers-hosts-and-contacts.md)
- [Event Checklist Template](./event-checklist-template.md)


I will add more as and when I can.
