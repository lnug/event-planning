# MC-guide

For your part as MC - it’s really up to you how you run things if you want, we have some standard slides and format - but if you want to enter with theme music and a mask and cape, it's all yours.  Here are some pointers: 

## in preparation
- create an issue as a TODO list for the evening based on one of the previous events. Here's an example: https://github.com/lnug/event-planning/issues/20
- prepare the slides. We have a standard slide deck which you can adapt as you need - or make your own - up to you: https://github.com/lnug/slides I always intend to do something different, but never find the time to do it..
- Think about the running order: think about when a good time to break will be and when to fit in all the smaller things like announcements. Sometime you can be a little flexible if there are only 2 talks scheduled - but we like to have things wrapped up around 9pm latest, or we start losing people, and it’s unfair on the later speaker. So if there are 3 talks - keep things moving. 
- have a timeline in mind, but be prepared to busk a little - things don't always go to plan (Pizza can be late, or an interesting talk can go on a bit...)
- check around with other organisers about any special announcements and sponsorship arrangements
- get in touch with the venue organisers beforehand and confirm when you'll be coming to get set up - it's usually good to get there about 30 mins to an hour before


## on the night
- get to the venue early
- meet the speakers when they arrive - and introduce them to the venue hosts and the other speakers and any other LNUG organisers that are around. Offer them a drink 
- Confirm with speakers a running order (sometimes they need to catch a train and leave early  - so work around that) 
- discuss timekeeping and the talk length - and what you will do to warn them when they start running over
- Announcements - there are a few standard announcements around communication, tweeting, code of conduct
- Fire/safety/toilets - I usually allow venue hosts to cover this and gives them a chance to say hi to the audience
- Sponsors: NearForm, Pusher and Conde Nast all need a big cheer - worth mentioning a couple times - there are slides for each
- Community announcements - there are usually points in the meetup TODO issue - fit them in where you can. Before the break is good. We usually invite anyone who has an open source project or community event to announce to take the mic for a minute.
- the buzz pre talks and in breaks is what makes LNUG really special - allow it to happen - even if you start a few minutes late - but don't be afraid to move on with the show
- Drinks After - we usually go to the closest pub - details are in the slide - worth confirming with  the venue hosts  - they may have good ideas
- If you can, stick around to the end and be with the last to leave - check that all is good: the venue is tidy, hosts are happy, camera operator has packed up. No stragglers! (people like to talk and sometimes need moving on) 
- Mostly: have fun and enjoy! It's really rewarding and uplifting to be 

## Afterwards (the next day)
- comment on the speakers repos issues for each speaker, thanking them for their contribution, and inviting feedback - tell them you'll let them know when videos are ready.
